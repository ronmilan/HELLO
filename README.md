# HELLOOOOOOO!

The Good Eggs display virtues within their community, but what are virtues? Virtues are positive traits, such as understanding, forgiveness, gratitude, generosity, cooperation, love, acceptance, respect, responsibility, honesty, confidence, and manners. They also learn about diversity as they travel to 10 countries, and come back to their hometown to learn the importance of community service! The Good Eggs help each other and make a positive difference in their lives and the lives of others.

 

You, too, can make a difference in someone's life. You can be like The Good Eggs by practicing these virtues, learning about diversity and helping others through community service! 


The Good Eggs series is Sandy Ciaramitaro's contribution to supporting children as they learn about virtues, diversity, and service â€“ essential concepts to integrate into their lives as they grow into Good Eggs! This Social Emotional Learning series is perfect for children ages 7-12.
